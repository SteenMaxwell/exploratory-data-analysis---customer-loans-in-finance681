## Description
### Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to extract a dataset(`loan_payments`) from an AWS RDS instance and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). This analysis aims to:
- Understand the dataset through transformations, visualisations, and insights.

Another aim of the project was to analyse specific columns in the dataset and assess whether certain criteria causes an increase in risk that a customer would not be able to repay their loan back in full. This would be supported by visualisations of the dataset to see the results found.

### Results Found
1) EDA insights:
   - The dataset was cleaned and analysed to address skewness, outliers, and collinearity between columns.
  
2) Analysis of Revenue loss and loss Indicators:
   - The Total Revenue Loss for the company for all Charged Off loans: Â£67,420,215.03
   - Loan Grade: Customers with lower grades (e.g., Grades D, E, F) posed a significantly higher risk of being Charged Off.
   - Loan Purpose: Loans for purposes like "small business" were highly correlated with increased risk.
  
These findings allow the company to identify high-risk loans and adjust strategies to minimise revenue loss.

### Visualisations of data
- **Correlation Matrix:**
  A heatmap visualising correlations between transformed columns in the dataset.

- **Revenue Loss Analysis:**
  A pie chart displaying the percentage of lost or at-risk revenue compared to expected revenue.

### What I learnt throughout the project
- Advanced `pandas` techniques for data manipulation and transformation.
- Effective visualisation skills using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Enhanced ability to interpret data insights and communicate findings in a structured manner.

## Installation instructions
1) Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SteenMaxwell/exploratory-data-analysis---customer-loans-in-finance681.git
   ```

2) Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1) **Run EDA workflow:**
   Open the `EDA_final_workflow.ipynb` notebook to perform exploratory data analysis and generate key insights.

2) **Run analysis overview:**
   Open the `analysis.ipynb` notebook to analyze risk factors and generate advanced visualisations.

## Files
`db_utils.py` - Contains python code to extract and save the data to a csv file from an AWS RDS database. The code in this file initialises a SQLAlchemy engine to do this, and stores the data locally in a pandas DataFrame.

`loan_payments_data.csv` - Database containing all the columns and rows needed for an EDA analysis
